# 08 - Importing

You can import the following formats via `Notable -> Import`:

- Markdown files with extension: `md`, `mkd`, `mdwn`, `mdown`, `markdown`, `markdn`, `mdtxt`, `mdtext` or `txt`.
- Evernotes' exports with extension: `enex`.

Alternatively you could also just put your Markdown notes into the `notes` sub-directory into your data directory.

The more notes you are importing the longer it will take, in some cases the interface may freeze until the operation is completed.

Newly imported tags will be tagged with a special `Import-XXXX` tag, so that you can easily edit them later using [multi-note editing](@note/09 - Multi-Note Editing.md).
